Here are some specific suggestions to enhance your practice:\n\n1. **Clarify Your Message:** It seems like there might have been some repetition or confusion, possibly due to improvising on the spot. Next time, take a quick moment to organize your thoughts silently\u2014think about the main point you want to convey. For example, if you're talking about a small habit that changed your life, decide on what that habit is and why it was impactful.\n\n2. **Use Clear, Simple Language:** Practice keeping your language straightforward. Words like \"shit\" and \"birthday\" may confuse your audience or distract from your message. If you're discussing a habit related to personal growth, choose words that clearly relate to that idea.\n\n3. **Structure Your Response:** Even in impromptu speaking, a simple structure helps. For example: \n   - **Intro:** Acknowledgement of the question.\n   - **Body:** Describe the habit and how it changed your life.\n   - **Conclusion:** Summarize the significance.\n\n4. **Pause and Breathe:** When practicing, try to pause briefly between points. This gives you time to gather your thoughts and makes your speech more composed and confident.\n\n5. **Practice Regularly:** To strengthen your impromptu skills, try quick exercises\u2014you can pick random topics and challenge yourself to speak for 1-2 minutes. Over time, you'll become more comfortable organizing your thoughts rapidly.\n\nRemember, the goal is progress, not perfection. Keep practicing with different prompts, and you'll see your confidence and clarity grow. You're doing a great job stepping up, and with a bit more preparation and practice, you'll be even more eloquent on the spot!"

One area to work on is reducing the filler words like \u201cum,\u201d \u201coh,\u201d and \u201csorry.\u201d These fillers can sometimes interrupt the flow and make your message feel less confident. \n\nHere are some specific tips:  \n- When you feel the urge to say \u201coh sorry,\u201d try to pause briefly instead. A short pause communicates confidence and gives you a moment to gather your thoughts.  \n- Practice your speech aloud a few times, focusing on the places where you tend to use fillers. As you do, replace those moments with a deliberate pause.  \n- It can also help to slow down your speech slightly; this reduces the likelihood of filling gaps with \u201cum\u201d or \u201clike.\u201d  \n\nYou\u2019re off to a great start\u2014just by becoming more aware of your filler words and practicing pauses, your delivery will sound even more confident and polished. Keep up the good work!"

            "last_feedback": "Thank you for sharing your initial thoughts! You're off to a good start by highlighting what you think utopia might mean. To strengthen your speech, I\u2019d encourage you to work on your transitions between ideas. Right now, the flow feels a bit choppy, especially when you move from questioning where utopia is to defining what it might mean.\n\nA helpful way to improve is to use transition phrases that link your ideas smoothly. For example, after saying, \u201cI don't know where utopia is,\u201d you could say, \u201cBut I believe it\u2019s about more than just a place; it\u2019s about what makes us happy.\u201d Then, when you move to your definition, you might continue with, \u201cSo, in my view, utopia is...\u201d This will make your speech feel more connected and easier for your audience to follow.\n\nKeep practicing these linking words or phrases\u2014they\u2019re like bridges that help your ideas flow seamlessly from one to the next. With some attention to your transitions, your speech will become clearer, more engaging, and easier for your audience to understand. You're doing great\u2014keep it up!"

One area that will really help strengthen your delivery is enhancing your vocal variety.\n\nRight now, your speech sounds quite monotone, which can make it challenging for your audience to stay engaged. To improve, try experimenting with different pitches, volumes, and speeds throughout your speech. For example, when you mention something exciting like \"chocolate and candies everywhere,\" you might elevate your pitch and speak a bit louder to emphasize the excitement. Conversely, when you're asking a question or expressing confusion, lowering your voice slightly can create contrast and draw your audience in.\n\nAdditionally, pausing briefly after a key point or question can add emphasis and give your listeners time to reflect. Practicing these variations will make your delivery more dynamic and keep your audience interested from start to finish.\n\nKeep up the great work, and don\u2019t be afraid to have fun with your voice\u2014your enthusiasm will shine through and make your speech even more compelling!"
